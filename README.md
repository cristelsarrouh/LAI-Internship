# LAI-Internship

This project represents the work that was done during my M2 Internship at the Adhesion & Inflammation Lab that focused on the deep understanding of early T cell literature through the use of AI/Text-mining tools.
The goal is to select relevant articles to our topic of interest, fetch the metadata as well as the PDFs associated, store them, and extract text from these PDFs. Upon doing that, we will use these extracted texts as our input and feed them to LLMs in order to facilitate the search of information in the scientific literature. 
We propose a pipeline as well as developed scripts in order to achieve these tasks in a semi-automated way.
